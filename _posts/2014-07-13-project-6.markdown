description: Designed a sleeve for pressure relief valve (PRV) to limit flow rate when venting in vacuum but not in pressure. This was difficult because there were already roughly 30,000 sensors distributed throughout North America and the timeline to roll-out a solution was ASAP. After lots of prototyping and validation testing the sleeve design was implemented because of its simplicity to manufacture and swap out existing sensors that were already sent out. This design change put name on an official patent for first time.
