description: Pictured top left is a project entered in a competition at the University of British Columbia. The goal is to manufacture an operational electrically driven ROV, and to maneuver through different obstacles and terrain. Sustainability, cost, weight and volume were also design considerations. The drive train used two motors held with a 3D printed mount and connected into a gearbox with a 16:1 ratio. The shape of the chassis was guided by a topology optimization simulation in SolidWorks. The materialâ€”balsa wood was also determined by looking through a material index software. An Ackermann steering system was used which was powered by a servo motor connected to an Arduino board.
